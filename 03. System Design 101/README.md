## Chapter 3. System Design 101

# Lesson 1. The Goal of System Design

https://academy.zerotomastery.io/courses/system-design/lectures/44070960

- This is important for senior developer interview

# Lesson 2. Principles of System Design - Availability

https://academy.zerotomastery.io/courses/system-design/lectures/44070958

Availability => Time the system is down (down time) for maintenance and updates. It is calculte in 9.

# Lesson 3. Principles of System Design - Reliability

https://academy.zerotomastery.io/courses/system-design/lectures/44070959

Reliability => Calculate failure

# Lesson 4. Networking - OSI & TCP/IP

https://academy.zerotomastery.io/courses/system-design/lectures/44071141

- There are 7 different lates of communications

7. Applicatin layer
8. Presentation Layer
9. Session layer
10. Transport layer
11. Network layer
12. Datalink layer
13. Physical layer

# Lesson 5. TCP IP

https://academy.zerotomastery.io/courses/system-design/lectures/44071138

TCP IP => Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol

# Lesson 6. TCP Explained

https://academy.zerotomastery.io/courses/system-design/lectures/44071140

TPC is the most used internet protoco

# Lesson 7. UDP

https://academy.zerotomastery.io/courses/system-design/lectures/44071139

It also an internet protocol, less common. Not data delivered garanted. It is used for live streaming

# Lesson 8. Proxies

https://academy.zerotomastery.io/courses/system-design/lectures/44071435

- Check <forward proxy> diagram. High and manage data from the client

- Check <reverse proxy> diagram. High and manage data from the server

- Check <reverse proxy-load balance> diagram. This is a very common practice, to use reverse proxy as load balance and also having the <cache> in the proxy.

# Lesson 9. Load Balancing Strategies

https://academy.zerotomastery.io/courses/system-design/lectures/44071434

# Lesson 10. Server Clustering

https://academy.zerotomastery.io/courses/system-design/lectures/44071433

- Check <server clustering> diagram

# Lesson 11. Databases Intro

https://academy.zerotomastery.io/courses/system-design/lectures/44163764

# Lesson 12. CAP Theorem CP

https://academy.zerotomastery.io/courses/system-design/lectures/44163782

C => Consistency
A => Availability
P => Partition tolerance

- Check <CAP Theorem> diagram

# Lesson 13. CAP Theorem AP

https://academy.zerotomastery.io/courses/system-design/lectures/44163932

# Lesson 14. ACID and BASE Properties for Database Selection

https://academy.zerotomastery.io/courses/system-design/lectures/44164018
